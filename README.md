This project is a personal website that is just exploring different things for myself. There may be some hidden urls that hold secondary projects.

## Deployment Process

TBD, probably will use github actions.

## Run the website locally

### Step 1: Clone the project
```sh
git clone https:github.com/melchords/new-portfolio.git
cd new-portfolio
```

### Step 2: Install NPM dependencies
```sh
cd src
npm i
```

### Step 3: Build and run dev
```sh
npm run build
npm run dev
```

This starts up the website on http://localhost:3000. As you make changes the site refreshes automatically in your browser.
